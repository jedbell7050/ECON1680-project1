# Project 1 - Machine Learning
This is the template for the first project for ECON1680: Machine Learning, Text Analysis, and Economics. This project is meant to be an economic application of machine learning. Over the course of the project, you should fill in the following sections of the Readme.md file below with your research question and motivation, your data sources, your methods, your results, and instructions for replciation. 

## Research Question
